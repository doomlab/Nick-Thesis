Previous research conducted on judgments of associative memory (JAM) has
found that these judgments tend to be stable and highly generalizable
across varying contexts (Maki, 2007a, 2007b; Valentine \& Buchanan,
2013). The JAM task can be viewed as a manipulation of the traditional
judgment of learning task (JOL). In a judgment of learning task,
participants are presented with cue-target word pairs and are asked to
make a judgment (typically on a scale of zero to 100) of how accurately
they would be able to respond with the proper target word based on the
presentation of a particular cue word (Dunlosky \& Nelson, 1994; Nelson
\& Dunlosky, 1991). JAM tasks expand upon this concept by changing the
focus of the judgments performed by participants. When presented with
the item pair, such as cheese-mouse, participants are asked to judge the
number of people out of 100 who would respond with the pair's target
word if they were only shown the cue (Maki, 2007a).

This process mimics the creation of associative words norms (i.e.,
forward strength; D. L. Nelson, McEvoy, and Schreiber (2004)). As such,
these judgments can be viewed as the participants' approximations of how
associatively related they perceive the paired items to be. The JAM
function can then be created by plotting participant judgments against
the word's normed associative strength and calculating a line of best
fit. This fit line typically displays a high intercept (bias) and a
shallow slope (sensitivity), meaning that participants are biased
towards overestimating the associative relatedness between word pairs,
and show difficulties differentiating between different amounts of item
relatedness (Maki, 2007a).

Building upon this research, we initially completed a pilot study in
which we sought to examine recall accuracy within the context of item
judgments, while also expanding the JAM task to incorporate judgments of
semantic and thematic memory. In the pilot study, 63 word-pairs of
varying associative, semantic, and thematic overlap were created and
arranged into three blocks, consisting of 21 word-pairs each.
Associative overlap was measured with forward strength (FSG; D. L.
Nelson et al. (2004)), semantic overlap was measured with cosine (COS;
McRae, Cree, Seidenberg, and McNorgan (2005)), and thematic relatedness
between pairs was measured with latent semantic analysis (LSA; Landauer
and Dumais (1997); Landauer, Foltz, and Laham (1998)). Participants were
randomly assigned to a condition in which they received a set of
instructions explaining either an associative, semantic, or thematic
relationship between words. Participants then judged the word-pairs in
each block based on the instructions that they received. The order of
block presentation and judgment instructions were counterbalanced so
that each word-pair received each of the three types of judgments. After
completing the judgment phase, participants then completed a cued recall
task in which they were presented with the cue word from each of the
previously presented word pairs and were asked to complete each pair
with the missing target.

Multilevel modeling was then used to predict recall and judgment scores.
This type of analysis was selected due to its ability to retain all data
points while controlling for correlated error between participants.
Significant three-way interactions were found between database norms
when predicting judgments (\(\beta\) = 3.324, \(p\) \textless{} .001)
and recall (\(\beta\) = 24.571, \(p\) \textless{} .001). Simple slopes
analyses were then conducted to further examine these interactions. When
semantic overlap was low, thematic and associative strength were
competitive, with increases in thematic overlap decreasing the strength
of associative overlap as a predictor. However, this trend saw a
reversal when semantic overlap was high, with thematic and associative
strength complimenting one another. This result was found when investing
the three-way interactions for both the judgment and recall tasks.
Overall, our findings from this study indicated the degree to which the
processing of associative, semantic, and thematic information impacts
retrieval and judgment making, while also displaying the interactive
relationship that exists between these three types of information.

The proposed study seeks to expand upon this work by extending the
original analysis to include multiple single word norms. These norms
provide information about different \enquote{neighborhoods} of concept
information. Broadly speaking, they can be separated into one of three
categories. Base values refer to norms which capture information based
on a word's structure. These include part of speech (PoS), word
frequency, and the number of syllables, morphemes, and phonemes that
comprise a word. Rated values refer to age of acquisition (AoA),
concreteness, imageability, valence, and familiarity. Finally, we seek
to examine norms that provide information about the connections a word
shares with others based on context. These norms include orthographic
neighborhood, phonographic neighborhood, cue and target set sizes, and
feature set size.

First, we are interested in assessing the impact of base word norms.
Chief amongst these is word frequency. Several sets of norms currently
exist for measuring the frequency with which words occur in everyday
language, and it is important to determine which of these offers the
best representation of everyday language. One of the most commonly used
collections of these norms is the Kucera and Francis (1967) frequency
norms. This set consists of frequency values for words, which were
generated by analyzing books, magazines, and newspapers. However, the
validity of using these norms has been questioned on factors such as the
properties of the sources analyzed, the size of the corpus analyzed, and
the overall age of these norms. First, these norms were created from an
analysis of written text. It is important to keep in mind that
stylistically, writing tends to be more formal than everyday language
and as a result, it may not be the best approximation of it (Brysbaert
\& New, 2009). Additionally, these norms were generated fifty years ago,
meaning that these norms may not accurately reflect the current state of
the English language. As such, the Kucera and Francis norms may not be
the best choice for researchers interested in gauging the effects of
word frequency.

Several viable alternatives to the KF frequency norms now exist. One
popular method is to use frequency norms obtained from the HAL corpus,
which consists of 131 million words (Burgess \& Lund, 1997; Lund \&
Burgess, 1996). Other collections of frequency norms include CELEX
(Baayen, Piepenbrock, \& Gulikers, 1995) which is based on written text,
the Zeno frequency norms (Zeno, Ivens, Millard, \& Duvvuri, 1995) which
were created from American children's textbooks, and Google Book's
collection of word frequencies which is derived from 131 billion words
taken from books published in the United States. (See Brysbaert,
Keuleers, and New (2011) for an overview and comparison of these norms
to SUBLTEX). For the present study, we plan to use data taken from the
both the SUBTLEX project (Brysbaert \& New, 2009), which is a collection
of frequency norms derived from a corpus of approximately 51 million
words, which were generated from movie and television subtitles, and the
HAL corpus. SUBTLEX norms are thought to better approximate everyday
language, as lines from movies and television tend to be more reflective
of everyday speech than writing samples. Additionally, the larger corpus
size of both SUBTLEX and HAL contributes to the validity of these norms
compared to KF frequency norms.

Next, we are interested in testing the effects of several measures of
lexical information related to the physical make-up of words. These
measures include the numbers of phonemes, morphemes, and syllables that
comprise each word as well as its part of speech. The number of phonemes
refers to the number of individual sounds that comprise a word (i.e.,
the word CAT has three phonemes, each of which correspond to the sounds
its letters make), while the term morpheme refers to the number of sound
units that contain meaning. DRIVE contains one morpheme, while DRIVER
contains two. Morphemes typically consist of root words and their
affixes. We are also interested in word length (measured as the number
of individual characters a word consists of) and the number of syllables
a word contains, as previous research has suggested that the number of
syllables may play a role in processing time. In general, longer words
require longer processing time (Kuperman, Stadthagen-Gonzalez, \&
Brysbaert, 2012), and shorter words tend to be more easily remembered
(Cowan, Baddeley, Elliott, \& Norris, 2003). Finally, we are interested
in the part of speech of each word. For the present study, part of
speech will be coded as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other, and will be
based on category size.

Third, we are interested in exploring the effects of norms measuring
word properties that are rated by participants. The first of these is
age of acquisition (AoA), which is a measure of the age at which a word
is learned. This norm is measured by presenting participants with a word
and having them enter the age (in years) in which they believe that they
would have learned the word (Kuperman et al., 2012). AoA ratings have
been found to be predictive of recall. For example, Dewhurst, Hitch, and
Barry (1998) found recall to be higher for late acquired words. Also of
interest are measures of a word's valence, which refers to its intrinsic
pleasantness or perceived positiveness. Valence ratings are important
across multiple psycholinguistic research settings. These include
research on emotion, the impact of emotion of lexical processing and
memory, estimating the sentiments of larger passages of text, and
estimating the emotional value of new words based on valence ratings of
semantically similar words (See Warriner, Kuperman, and Brysbaert (2013)
for a review). The next of these rated measures is concreteness, which
refers to the degree that a word relates to a perceptible object
(Brysbaert, Warriner, \& Kuperman, 2013). Similar to concreteness,
imageability is described as being a measure of a word's ability to
generate a mental image (Stadthagen-Gonzalez \& Davis, 2006). Both
imageability and concreteness have been linked to recall, as items rated
higher in these areas tend to be more easily recalled (Nelson \&
Schreiber, 1992) Finally, familiarity norms can be described as an
application of word frequency. These norms measure the frequency of
exposure to a particular word (Stadthagen-Gonzalez \& Davis, 2006).

The final group of norms that we are interested in examining are those
which provide information based on connections with neighboring words.
Phonographic neighborhood refers to refers to the number of words that
can be created by changing one sound in a word (i.e., CAT to KITE).
Similarly, orthographic neighborhood refers to the number of words
created by changing a single letter in word (i.e., CAT to BAT, Adelman
and Brown (2007); Peereman and Content (1997)). Previous findings have
suggested that the frequency of a target word relative to that of its
orthographic neighbors has an effect on recall, increasing the
likelihood of recall for that word (Carreiras, Perea, \& Grainger,
1997). Additionally, both of measures have been found to effect
processing speed for items (Adelman \& Brown, 2007; Buchanan, Holmes,
Teasley, \& Hutchison, 2013; Coltheart, Davelaar, Jonasson, \& Besner,
1977). Next, we are interested in examining two single word norms that
are directly related to item associations. These norms measure the
number of associates a word shares connections with. Cue set size (QSS)
refers to the number of cue words that a target word is connected to,
while target set size (TSS) is a count of the number of target words a
cue word is connected to (Schreiber and Nelson (1998)). Previous
research has shown evidence for a cue set size effect in which cue words
that are linked to a larger number of associates (target words) are less
likely to be recalled than cue words linked to fewer target words (D. L.
Nelson, Schreiber, \& Xu, 1999). As such, we will also calculate set
size values for the semantic feature overlap and thematic overlap word
norms. Finally, feature list sizes will be calculated for each word
overlap norm from the Buchanan et al. 2013 semantic feature norm set.

In summary, this study seeks to expand upon previous work by examining
how single word norms belonging to these three neighborhoods of item
information impact the accuracy of item judgments and recall. These
findings will be assessed within the context of associative, semantic,
and thematic memory systems. Specifically, we utilize a three-tiered
view of the interconnections between these systems as it relates to
processing concept information. First, semantic information is
processed, which provides a means for categorizing concepts based on
feature similarity. Next, processing moves into the associative memory
network, where contextual information pertaining to the items is added.
Finally, the thematic network incorporates information from both the
associative and semantic networks to generate a mental representation of
the concept containing both the items meaning and its place in the
world.

As such, the present study has two aims. First, we seek to replicate the
interaction results from the pilot study using a new set of stimuli.
These three-way interactions occurred between the associative, semantic,
and thematic database norms when predicting participant judgments and
recall. Second, we wish to expand upon these findings by extending the
analysis to include neighborhood information for the item pairs. The
extended analysis will be run by introducing the different types single
word norms through a series of steps based on the type of neighborhood
they belong to. First, base word norms will be analyzed. Next, measures
of word ratings will be analyzed. Third, single word norms measuring
connections between concepts will be analyzed. Finally, network norms
and their interactions will be reanalyzed. The end goal is to determine
both which neighborhood of norms have the greatest overall impact on
recall and judgment ability, and to further assess the impact of network
connections after controlling for the various neighborhoods of single
word information.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

A power analysis was conducted using the \(SIMR\) package in \(R\)
(Green \& MacLeod, 2016), which uses simulations to calculate power for
mixed linear models created from the \(LME4\) and \(nlme\) packages (D.
Bates, Machler, Bolker, \& Walker, 2015; Pinheiro, Bates, Debroy,
Sarkar, \& R Core Team, 2017). The results of this analyses suggested a
minimum of 35 participants was required to find an effect at 80\% power.
However, because power often is underestimated (Brysbaert \& Stevens,
2018), we plan to extend the analysis to include 200 participants, a
number determined by the amount of available funding. Participants will
be recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which is a website where
individuals can host projects and be connected with a large respondent
pool who complete tasks for small amounts of money (Buhrmester, Kwang,
\& Gosling, 2011). Participants will be paid \$2.00 for their
participation. Participant responses will be screened for a basic
understanding of study instructions.

\subsection{Material}\label{material}

First, mimicking the design of the original pilot study, sixty-three
word pairs of varying associative, semantic, and thematic overlap were
created to use as stimuli. These word pairs were created using the
Buchanan et al. (2013) word norm database. Next, neighborhood
information for all cue and target items was collected. Word frequency
was collected from the SUBTLEX project (Brysbaert \& New, 2009) and the
HAL corpus (Burgess \& Lund, 1997). Part of speech (POS), word length,
and the number of morphemes, phonemes, and syllables of each item was
derived from the Buchanan et al. (2013) word norms. For items with
multiple parts of speech (for example, Drink can refer to both a
beverage and the act of drinking a beverage), the most commonly used
form was used. Following the design of Buchanan et al. (2013), this was
determined using Google's \enquote{Define}" feature. Concreteness, cue
set size (QSS), and target set size (TSS) were taken from the South
Florida Free Association Norms (D. L. Nelson et al., 2004). Imageability
and familiarity norms were taken from the (Toglia, 2009; Toglia \&
Battig, 1978) semantic word norms. Age of acquisition ratings (AoA) were
pulled from the (Kuperman et al., 2012) database. Finally, valence
ratings for all items were obtained from the (Warriner et al., 2013)
norms. After gathering neighborhood information, network norms measuring
associative, semantic, and thematic overlap were generated for each
pair. Forward strength (FSG) was used as a measure of associative
overlap. FSG is a value ranging from zero to one which measures of the
probability that a cue word will elicit a particular target word in
response to it (D. L. Nelson et al., 2004). Cosine (COS) strength was
used to measure semantic overlap between concepts (Buchanan et al.
(2013); McRae et al. (2005); Vinson and Vigliocco (2008)). As with FSG,
this value ranges from zero to one, with higher values indicating more
shared features between concepts. Finally, thematic overlap was measured
with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which is a measure generated based
upon the co-occurrences of words within a document (Landauer \& Dumais,
1997; Landauer et al., 1998). Like the measures of associative and
semantic overlap, LSA values range from zero to one, with higher values
indicating higher co-occurrence between items. As such, the selected
stimuli contained a range of values across both the network and
neighborhood norms. As with the pilot study, stimuli will be arranged
into three blocks, with each block consisting of 21 word pairs. The
blocks will be structured to have seven words of low COS (0 - .33),
medium COS (.34 - .66), and high COS (.67 - 1). COS was chosen due to
both limitations with the size of the available dataset and the desire
to recreate the selection process used for the pilot study. The result
of this selection process is that values for the remaining network norms
(FSG and LSA) and information neighborhood norms will be contingent upon
the COS strengths of the selected stimuli. To counter this, we selected
stimuli at random based on the different COS groupings so as to cover a
broad range of FSG, LSA, and information neighborhood values.

The stimuli will be presented to the participants online via Qualtrics
surveys. Three different surveys will be created, which will
counter-balance the order in which stimuli blocks are presented.
Judgment conditions will be counter-balanced across blocks, so that each
word pair receives a judgment for each type of memory. Finally, word
pairs will be randomized within blocks.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

This study will be divided into three sections. First, participants will
be presented with word pairs and will be asked to judge how related the
items are to one another. This section will comprise three blocks, with
each block containing 21 word pairs. Each item block will be preceded by
a set of instructions explaining one of the three types of
relationships. Participants will also be provided with examples
illustrating the type of relationship to be judged. The associative
instructions explain associative relationships between concepts, how
these relationships can be strong or weak, and the role of free
association tasks in determining the magnitude of these relationships.
The semantic instructions will provide participants with a brief
overview of how words can be related by meaning and will give
participants examples of item pairs with high and low levels of semantic
overlap. Finally, the thematic instructions will explain how concepts
can be connected by overarching themes. These instruction sets are
modeled after Buchanan (2010) and Valentine and Buchanan (2013).

Participants will then rate the relatedness of the word pairs based on
the set of instructions they receive at the start of each judgment
block. These judgments will be made using a scale of zero (no
relatedness between pairs) to one hundred (a perfect relationships).
Judgments were recorded by the participant typing it into the survey.
Participants will complete each of the three judgment blocks in this
manner, with judgment instructions changing with each block. Three
versions of the study will be created to counter balance the order in
which judgment blocks appear. Participants will be randomly assigned to
survey conditions. After completing the judgment blocks, participants
will be presented with a short distractor task to account for recency
effects. This section will be timed to last two minutes, and will task
participants with alphabetizing a scrambled list of the fifty U.S.
states. Once two minutes elapses, participants will automatically
progress to a cued recall task, in which they will be presented with
each of the 63 cues that had previously been judged as cue-target pairs.
Participants will be asked to complete each word pair with the
appropriate target word, based on the available cue word. Presentation
of these pairs will be randomized, and participants will be informed
that there is no penalty for guessing.

\section{Results}\label{results}

First, the results from the recall section will be coded as zero for
incorrect responses and one for correct responses. NA will be used to
denote missing responses from participants who did not complete the
recall section. Responses that are words instead of numbers in the
judgment phase will be deleted and treated as missing data. Data will
then be screened for out of range judgment responses (i.e., responses
greater than 100), recall and judgment scores will be screened for
outliers using Mahalanobis distance at p \textless{} .001, and
multicollinearity between predictor variables will be measured with
Pearson correlations. Mean judgment and recall scores will also be
reported for each judgment condition.

Multilevel modeling will then be used to analyze the data. First,
network norms and neighborhood norms will be mean centered, so as to
control for multicollinearity. Next, two maximum likelihood multilevel
models will be created. These models will be both use the network norms
as predictors and will examine their effects on recall and judgments.
The goal of these models is to replicate three-way interaction findings
from the pilot study. If significant three-way interactions are found
between the network norms, these interactions will be broken down with
moderation analyses. Finally, neighborhood norms will be added
introduced into each model in steps. Initially, base word norms will be
added, followed by lexical information, rated properties, and norms
measuring neighborhood connections.
