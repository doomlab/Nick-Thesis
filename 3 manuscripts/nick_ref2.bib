abstract = {This research is concerned with determining how subjects falsify statements like A collie is a cat. A multiple regression analysis was performed which used 22 variables to try to predict the negative judgment times. The predictive variables are time to generate the superordinate of the instance (for example, dog), time to falsify that the superordinate is the predicate (for example, A dog is a cat), and time to encode the instance. This finding and others indicate that a prominent negation strategy is one in which the subject generates the superset of an instance and falsifies that the superset is the predicate. Auxiliary regression analyses are also reported for other reaction time measures gathered in the experiments. It is argued that large-scale regression experiments are critical to the inferential logic of a semantic memory experiment. {\textcopyright} 1974 Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The influence of most variables was highly task dependent, with the results shedding light on recent empirical controversies in the available word recognition literature. Semantic-level variables accounted for unique variance in both speeded naming and lexical decision performance, level with the latter task producing the largest semantic-level effects.

Further analyses indicate that word frequencies derived from recent books (published after 2000) are better predictors of word processing times than frequencies based on the full corpus, and that word frequencies based on fiction books predict word processing times better than word frequencies based on the full corpus. The most predictive word frequencies from Google still do not explain more of the variance in word recognition times of undergraduate students and old adults than the subtitle-based word frequencies.},

abstract = {In psychology, attempts to replicate published findings are less successful than expected. For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80{\%}, whereas in practice less than 40{\%} of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

In the first task, participants were asked to say the first associate that came to mind when they saw a stimulus word; the second task involved a semantic categorisation between words with a definable meaning and first names. In both tasks, there were significantly faster responses to earlier-acquired than to later-acquired words.

The conclusion was that semantic vectors of pointwise mutual information values from very small co-occurrence windows, together with a cosine distance measure, consistently resulted in the best representations across a range of psychologically relevant semantic tasks. This article extends that study by investigating the use of three further factors--namely, the application of stop-lists, word stemming, and dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD)--that have been used to provide improved performance elsewhere. It also introduces an additional semantic task and explores the advantages of using a much larger corpus. This leads to the discovery and analysis of improved SVD-based methods for generating semantic representations (that provide new state-of-the-art performance on a standard TOEFL task) and the identification and discussion of problems and misleading results that can arise without a full systematic study.},

Higher levels of neighborhood density produced an inhibitory trend in the progressive-demasking task, facilitation in lexical decision (significant only when neighborhood density was blocked), and a robust facilitation effect in naming (only for words with higher frequency neighbors).

In the present study, we examined the influence of item similarity and associative strength on judgments of learning (JOLs) in a cued recall task. We hypothesized that encoding fluency would cause a foresight bias, so that subjects would overestimate recall of identical pairs (scale-scale), as compared with strong associates (weight-scale) or unrelated pairs (mask-scale). In Experiment 1, JOLs for identical word pairs were higher than those for related and unrelated pairs, but later recall of identical pairs was lower than recall of related pairs. In Experiment 2, the effect of encoding fluency (inferred from self-paced study time) was examined, and a similar pattern of results was obtained, with subjects spending the least amount of time studying identical pairs. We conclude that overconfidence for identical pairs reflects an assessment of item similarity when JOLs are made, despite associative strength being a better predictor of later retrieval.},

abstract = {Paired associated learning (PAL) is a critical skill for making arbitrary associations among print, pronunciation and meaning in reading development. Extended from past research of PAL, this study investigated whether PAL operated flexibly to linguistic demands of languages, by examining word reading abilities in Chinese–English bilingual children. One hundred and twenty-one 8-year-old Chinese–English bilingual children in Hong Kong were included. Children were administered nonverbal reasoning and PAL tasks (condition 1: visual-pronunciation PAL pair; condition 2: visual-semantics PAL pair), as well as Chinese and English measures of phonological processing and word reading. Results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that PAL performance contributed to word reading, after the effects of nonverbal reasoning and phonological processing were accounted for. Specifically, visual-semantics PAL predicted Chinese word reading, while visual-pronunciation PAL predicted English word reading. These findings have indicated that visual–verbal PAL and phonological processing represent unique mechanisms important to reading in Chinese and English. The differential roles of visual-pronunciation and visual-semantics mappings suggest cognitive processes in reading acquisition, like PAL, might be flexible in bilinguals. Different mechanisms could be utilized in learning to read various scripts depending on the scripts' characteristics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Factor analysis of 32 properties identified 9 orthogonal factors and demonstrated both the redundancy among various measures and the tendency for some attributes (e.g., age of acquisition) to load on multiple factors. The second extension collected basic ratings of imagery, familiarity, and a new age of acquisition measure for a larger pool of 2,311 words, including parts of speech other than nouns. The analysis of these ratings and supplementary statistics computed for the words (e.g., number of syllables, Kucera-Francis frequency) demonstrated again the relative independence of various measures and the importance of obtaining diverse properties for such norms.

abstract = {Younger and older adults studied lists of words directly (e.g., creek, water) or indirectly (e.g., beaver, faucet) related to a nonpresented critical lure (CL; e.g., river). Indirect (i.e., mediated) lists presented items that were only related to CLs through nonpresented mediators (i.e., directly related items). Following study, participants completed a condition-specific task, math, a recall test with or without a warning about the CL, or tried to guess the CL. On a final recognition test, warnings (vs. math and recall without warning) decreased false recognition for direct lists, and guessing increased mediated false recognition (an ironic effect of guessing) in both age groups. The observed age-invariance of the ironic effect of guessing suggests that processes involved in mediated false memory are preserved in aging and confirms the effect is largely due to activation in semantic networks during encoding and to the strengthening of these networks during the interpolated tasks.},

abstract = {Lists of short words usually are recalled better than lists of longer words in immediate recall tasks. Such word length effects might be explained by localist accounts, in which the length of each word in a list affects the recall of that word only, or by globalist accounts, in which the lengths of at least some words affect the recall of other words (e.g., Baddeley, 1986). In a recent localist account, Neath and Nairne (1995) proposed that the recall of each word depends on the likelihood that features within the word are contaminated within the memory representation. We tested this by presenting not only homogeneous lists of short and long words, but also mixed lists, and by including articulatory suppression on some trials. The short-word advantage depended on the composition of the list, ruling out a strictly localist approach. There appear to be several globalist influences on recall, including distinctiveness factors as well as phonological storage and articulation.},

abstract = {We report a study that directly compares the comprehension skills of patients with refractory access and static storage semantic deficits. It has been reported previously, in the context of matching to sample tasks, that the performance of both types of patients may be affected by the semantic relatedness of competing responses. However, it has been hypothesised that such effects of semantic distance may reflect different processes (Warrington {\&} Cipolotti, 1996). More specifically, semantic relatedness effects following refractory access deficits may be explained in terms of the effect of refractoriness on representations that share semantic space, whilst relatedness effects consequent to storage deficits may reflect the preferential sparing of superordinate rather than item-specific information. In this series of experiments, we compare and contrast refractory access and storage patients on word-picture matching tasks that manipulate the semantic relatedness of items within a response array. In particular, the interaction of semantic distance and item frequency is explored. We also provide evidence of gradients of semantic relatedness in our refractory assess patient, and consider what information such patients can provide about extremely fine-grain conceptual organisation.},

In this article, we present 4 experiments showing that there are reliable and systematic patterns in how people evaluate the similarities between very dissimilar entities. We present a semantic network account of these similarities showing that a spreading activation mechanism defined over a word association network naturally makes correct predictions about weak similarities, whereas, though simpler, models based on direct neighbors between word pairs derived using the same network cannot.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe the most extensive set of word associations collected to date. The database contains over 12,000 cue words for which more than 70,000 participants generated three responses in a multiple-response free association task. The goal of this study was (1) to create a semantic network that covers a large part of the human lexicon, (2) to investigate the implications of a multiple-response procedure by deriving a weighted directed network, and (3) to show how measures of centrality and relatedness derived from this network predict both lexical access in a lexical decision task and semantic relatedness in similarity judgment tasks. First, our results show that the multiple-response procedure results in a more heterogeneous set of responses, which lead to better predictions of lexical access and semantic relatedness than do single-response procedures. Second, the directed nature of the network leads to a decomposition of centrality that primarily depends on the number of incoming links or in-degree of each node, rather than its set size or number of outgoing links. Both studies indicate that adequate representation formats and sufficiently rich data derived from word associations represent a valuable type of information in both lexical and semantic processing.},

abstract = {A number of properties of word associations, generated in a continuous task, were investigated. First, we investigated the correspondence of word class in association cues and responses. Nouns were the modal word class response, regardless of the word class of the cue, indicating a dominant paradigmatic response style. Next, the word association data were used to build an associative network to investigate the centrality of nodes. The study of node centrality showed that central nodes in the network tended to be highly frequent and acquired early. Small-world properties of the association network were investigated and compared with a large English association network (Steyvers {\&} Tenenbaum, 2005). Networks based on a multiple association procedure showed small-world properties despitebeing denser than networks based on a discrete task. Finally, a semantic taxonomy was used to investigate the composition of semantic types in association responses. The majority of responses were thematically related situation responses and entity responses referring to parts, shape, or color. Since the association task required multiple responses per cue, the interaction between generation position and semantic role could be investigated and discussed in the framework of recent theories of natural concept representations (Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, {\&} Wilson, in press).},

Experiment 2 replicated the AoA effect by using a different set of early- and late-acquired words. Experiment 3 found advantages for low-frequency and late-acquired words in recall, but only when words were presented in mixed lists. The frequency effect was reversed, and the AoA effect was eliminated, when participants studied pure lists. Findings were attributed to the more distinctive encoding of low-frequency and late-acquired words. ((c) 1998 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Judgments of learning (JOLs) made immediately after items are studied have been shown to be insensitive to the way in which eventual memory performance is affected by (a) imagery versus rote rehearsal and (b) distributed versus massed repetitions. One explanation is that JOLs made immediately after study assess transient information that affects JOLs but is not predictive of eventual memory performance. Accordingly, we hypothesized that if the JOLs are delayed until the transient information about the to-be-judged item has dissapated, they might more accurately assess the effects of the study activities on subsequent retention. Our two experiments confirmed that hypothesis. The magnitude of delayed JOLs was greater after interactive imagery than after rote rehearsal (Experiment 1) and was greater after distributed repetitions than after massed repetitions (Experiment 2). Also, the distributions of JOLs indicated greater confidence (polarization) for delayed JOLs than for immediate JOLs, and the accuracy of predicting item-by-item retention was greater for delayed JOLs than for immediate JOLs in every condition (rote rehearsal, interactive imagery, single presentations, massed repetitions, and distributed repetitions). Thus people's timing of their JOLs is critical for several aspects of metacognition.},

abstract = {The present experiments represent a phenomenon in which people experienced an illusion of knowing such that they were overconfident in their ability to remember information they subsequently were unable to recall. Semantic associates of cues served as targets and were studied during the original and interpolated study phases of a retroactive interference paradigm in either an intralist (cue-target together) or extralist (targets alone) cueing procedure. The paradigm was modified to include a prediction-of-knowing (POK) metamemory phase during which people predicted their performance on a subsequent recall test. Memory performance was worse when the cue was repaired with a second semantic associate (interference condition) than in the control condition. However, POKs were more positive in the interference condition. Even when people were told not to base their predictions on any information from the second list and were specifically told which information to eliminate from consideration (Exp. 2), they were unable to do so. The findings are discussed in terms of potential sources of metamemory predictions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For word repetition, children displayed more of an advantage for the recognition of early-acquired items from sparse vs dense neighborhoods than did adults; adults showed a greater advantage for the recognition of later-acquired items. Regression analyses revealed that the recognition of early-acquired items from sparse neighborhoods contributed to phonological awareness among individual children. In turn, phonological awareness, receptive vocabulary, and verbal short-term memory contributed to word reading. These findings are discussed in terms of recent proposals about the level of processing at which neighborhood density exerts either facilitatory or inhibitory effects. The development of phonological awareness and early reading skill is also discussed.},

This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure.},

@article{Hampton2006,
abstract = {The Prototype Theory of conceptual representation in large part owes its beginnings to Rosch and Mervis (1975), who, in the space of a couple of years, published a string of major papers laying out the empirical basis for the theory. The motivation for the theory came from a perceived crisis in philosophy and linguistics to do with defining the meaning of words. To the lay person, who has never worried too much about such things, the meaning of words is just given in the dictionary. The trouble is that most dictionary definitions are really only approximate or partial. The word "red," for example, is not defined by a fixed interval of the color spectrum but is the name for an imprecisely defined region with vague edges. The word "chair" could perhaps be defined as a movable object made for sitting on that stands on the floor and has a back. However, once again the actual use of the word tends in practice to allow for vagueness-designers continually create new objects for sitting on and new contexts in which to sit, so that it is often unclear whether they should be counted as chairs or not. The central insight of Prototype Theory is that word meanings and the conceptual classes that the words name are distinguished one from another not in terms of an explicit definition but in terms of similarity to a generic or best example. The concept red is the class of colors that are centered around a particular point on the spectrum that everyone tends to agree is the prototype red. Berlin and Kay (1969) reported that there was better agreement about the best examples of color terms than there was about the boundary between one color and another (e.g., between red and orange). The category of red things is therefore the category of things whose color is sufficiently similar to a prototypical red (and dissimilar from other prototypes). Similarly, there are concept representations for "chair" and "stool" and "bench" and "sofa," each of which is associated with a prototype example of the class. Objects are then classified on the basis of which prototype they are most similar to. Rosch, Simpson and Miller (1976) showed that people could readily learn novel categories based around prototypes (a point already demonstrated by Posner {\&} Keele, 1968), and Rosch and Mervis (1975) analyzed a number of semantic categories, such as fruit, sport, or vehicle, to show that what members of the category had in common was not some set of defining features but a sufficient degree of resemblance to each other. In some of their writings, it is implied that the best example of the category, whatever that might be, would be the prototype. However, it quickly became clear that the prototype should better be considered as a more abstract, generic concept that was constituted from the different ways in which the category members resembled each other and differed from nonmembers. Unlike a best example, an abstract prototype allows for the representation of different possible values of relevant features such as that apples can be red, green, brown, or yellow or that furniture can be sat on, slept on, used for storing things, or provide a surface for supporting things. An apple that had all these colors or a piece of furniture that served all these functions would not necessarily be prototypical. Prototypes then are the centers of clusters of similar objects and prototype concepts form similarity-based categories. The center of the cluster is well established and agreed upon, but the boundary between one category and another may be subject to vagueness and disagreement. Talk of clusters with centers implies a spatial metaphor, and prototypes have often been discussed as points in similarity space. A mathematical exploration of the implications of this approach can be found in G??rdenfors (2000), and Osherson and Smith (1981) included a similarity space as part of their formalization of Prototype Theory. Spaces, however, have additional structural properties, which impose unnecessarily strict constraints on prototypes. Verbeemen, Storms, and Verguts (2004) have explored the degree to which natural categories can be represented in spaces (through multidimensional scaling) and concluded that at least for some semantic domains, a nonspatial similarity model provides a better fit. Following its introduction into cognitive psychology, Prototype Theory was also taken up enthusiastically by cognitive linguists, such as Ross (1973) and Lakoff (1987), and anthropologists such as Kempton (1978) and Randall (1976). Ross (1973), for example, proposed that the syntactic class NOUN in English is based around a prototype. He suggested a scale of "nouniness" associated with a hierarchy of syntactic acceptability in different contexts. The more nouny a word or phrase was, then the more contexts in which it would behave like a noun. A useful source of different views on the value of prototypes in linguistic theory can be found in Aarts, Denison, Keizer, and Popova (2004). While Rosch and Mervis provided overwhelming evidence for widespread prototype effects in semantic concepts and category learning, the development of the theory in psychology subsequently remained relatively underspecified. In one of the last chapters in the series, Eleanor Rosch (1978) discussed the theoretical underpinning of the data and warned that a distinction should be made between the empirical phenomena of prototype effects and any theoretical model that concepts are actually represented by prototypes. In fact, she doubted that the latter was the case. The purpose of this chapter will be to reexamine Prototype Theory and the evidence with which it is associated. One of the major difficulties with the theory may be that, with the early withdrawal of Rosch from the field, it has lacked a champion to develop and refine a working model of prototype representations, as new empirical results have been discovered. Thus, at various times, the theory has been criticized in many ways. For example, it is claimed that the theory lacks any way to represent the variability allowed on different dimensions within a category (e.g., the range of possible sizes of apples rather than just their average size). The theory is said not to be able to account for some categories having wider or more flexible boundaries than others [and, hence, is unable to explain why a sphere half-way in size between a basketball and a watermelon is more likely to be a watermelon than a basketball; (Rips, 1989)]. The theory is said to rely too heavily on statistical cue validity to determine feature weights (i.e., on the relative frequency of the feature for members and nonmembers of the category) and so to ignore causal dependencies among features such as that birds need their wings in order to fly. The theory is said to be circular in that no account is offered of why our attention is drawn to particular sets of features or particular sets of objects in the first place. In every case, the criticisms may be well-founded, but what has been lacking is a coordinated attempt to modernize the theory to incorporate mechanisms to deal with the failures. It is, of course, easy to find data that a model has no way of explaining, if the model was not created with those data in mind. However, one is then faced with a choice of discarding the model altogether or of adapting the model to fit the data. A notable exception to the lack of development of Prototype Theory has been the work on category learning of Don Homa and colleagues (Homa, 1984; Homa, Sterling, {\&} Trepel, 1981) and Smith and Minda (2000). Both of these groups of researchers have generated valuable evidence that in classification learning paradigms, there are conditions under which abstraction of prototypes does occur. They have also developed precise quantitative models of how prototypes develop and are used in such learning situations. The question remains, however, whether the original aim of Prototype Theory-to provide an account of the natural concepts that we use to understand our everyday world and that serve to support the meanings of common nouns in natural language-can be met satisfactorily. The chapter therefore will focus on the original evidence on which Prototype Theory was based and will discuss which aspects of that evidence should be retained as central to the theory and which aspects may be less crucial. I will also use this opportunity to present new results relating to prototype effects and to reflect on some of the theoretical debates that surround the model. There is a nice irony here, in that the theory as applied to itself would suggest quite plausibly that "Prototype Theory" as a concept is itself a family of related concepts in which different importance might be attached to different assumptions of the theory. A prototype of Prototype Theory might be that presented by Rosch and Mervis, or that described in Hampton (1995), but other characterizations have been offered (Osherson {\&} Smith, 1981). Leaving this irony aside, it is important first to try to capture the more essential characteristics of a prototype model, in order to consider how the central insights of the approach can be made consistent with evidence on the nature of conceptual representation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The authors addressed this long-standing debate by examining how a large-scale computational model based on connectionist principles would solve the problem and comparing the model's performance to people's. In contrast to previous models, the present model uses an architecture in which meanings are jointly determined by the 2 components, with the division of labor between them affected by the nature of the mappings between codes. The model is consistent with a variety of behavioral phenomena, including the results of studies of homophones and pseudohomophones thought to support other theories, and illustrates how efficient processing can be achieved using multiple simultaneous constraints.},

Correlations of JOLs with item recall for a randomly yoked learner indicated that access to one's own encoding experiences increased relative accuracy.

abstract = {The present research investigates semantic priming with an adapted version of the word fragment completion task. In this task, which we refer to as the speeded word fragment completion task, participants need to complete words such as lett{\_}ce (lettuce), from which one letter was omitted, as quickly as possible. This paradigm has some interesting qualities in comparison with the traditionally used lexical decision task. That is, it requires no pseudowords, it is more engaging for participants, and most importantly, it allows for a more fine-grained investigation of semantic activation. In two studies, we found that words were completed faster when the preceding trial comprised a semantically related fragment such as tom{\_}to (tomato) than when it comprised an unrelated fragment such as guit{\_}r (guitar). A third experiment involved a lexical decision task, to compare both paradigms. The results showed that the magnitude of the priming effect was similar, but item-level priming effects were inconsistent over tasks. Crucially, the speeded word fragment completion task obtained strong priming effects for highly frequent, central words, such as work, money, and warm, whereas the lexical decision task did not. In a final experiment featuring only short, highly frequent words, the lexical decision task failed to find a priming effect, whereas the fragment completion task did obtain a robust effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the speeded word fragment completion task may prove a viable alternative for examining semantic priming.

This article investigates the extent that these processes rely on cognitive resources by experimentally manipulating working memory load. To disentangle prospective and retrospective pro- cesses, prime–target pairs were selected such that they were symmetrically associated (e.g., answer- question; SYM) or asymmetrically associated in either the forward direction (e.g., panda-bear; FA) or the backward direction (e.g., ball-catch; BA). The results showed that priming for FA pairs completely evaporated under a high working memory load but that it remained stable for BA and SYM pairs. This was taken to mean that prospective processes, which are assumed to cause FA priming, require cognitive resources, whereas retrospective processes, which lead to BA priming, are relatively effortless.},

abstract = {In three experiments we evaluated semantic priming when the prime was masked below naming threshold and the target was named. Experiment 1 found that when word primes were masked and word targets were named, prior knowledge of the related pairs did not alter semantic priming. How- ever, semantic priming within categories occurred only when the prime stimulus was the first cate- gory exemplar. Experiment 2 found that when masked pictures were used as primes, semantic prim- ing for word targets was highly sensitive to the category exemplar level of the prime but not to the category exemplar level of the target. Word association norms collected in Experiment 3 did not support the hypothesis that the effect of category exemplar level was mediated by the strength of word association. Experiment 4 found significant semantic priming for masked picture primes and within-category word targets, regardless of the level of word association between the prime and target. Experiment 4 also demonstrated semantic priming for high word association targets that were not members of the same semantic category. For all experiments, the subjects with the longest average reaction times also showed the largest semantic priming effect for naming word targets. We hypothe- sized that viewing one of the highest ranking category exemplars activates the memory representa- tion of the category, perhaps because such prototypic exemplars are contained within the category concept itself},

Mediated lists (e.g., faucet, London, jog) contained words related to the CI through a nonpresented mediator. After each study list, participants completed either a recall test, a recall test with a warning about the CI, arithmetic problems, or a recognition test, or they guessed the CI. On a final recognition test, both warning and guessing decreased direct false recognition but increased mediated false recognition, an ironic effect of guessing. An initial recognition test also increased final mediated false recognition. We argue that warning and guessing tasks strengthened associative pathways to the CI, increased the accessibility of associated mediators, and increased monitoring for the CI at test. Increased monitoring was able to reduce CIs from direct, but not mediated, lists.},

The most important conclusion is that automatic priming appears to be due to both association strength and feature overlap. Mediated associates provide the strongest evidence of automatic associative priming, whereas functional associates, synonyms, and antonyms instead support priming based on feature overlap. In contrast, automatic priming does not occur for category coordinates or perceptually similar items, at least when presented in the visual modality. The status of other relations, such as collocates, episodic relatives, and script relations, is unclear and requires further experimentation.

Associative strength from the list items to the critical item was equated across the two types of lists. In Experiments 1-5, patterns of veridical memory differed across the two types of lists; however, false memory of the critical item did not differ. This same pattern occurred regardless of whether the words diverging onto the two meanings of the homograph were presented blocked or intermixed, whether each list item was presented for 80 ms, 200 or 1200 ms during encoding, and whether a recall or recognition test was given. In Experiment 6, critical nonpresented items that followed lists converging onto one meaning were judged as more strongly related to the list.

Young and older adults performed either lexical decision (LDT) or naming tasks. A multiple regression procedure was used to predict priming based upon prime characteristics, target characteristics, and prime-target semantic similarity. Results indicate that semantic priming (a) can be reliably predicted at an item level; (b) is equivalent in magnitude across standardized measures of priming in LDTs and naming tasks; (c) is greater following quickly recognized primes; (d) is greater in LDTs for targets that produce slow lexical decision latencies; (e) is greater for pairs high in forward associative strength across tasks and across stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs); (f) is greater for pairs high in backward associative strength in both tasks, but only at a long SOA; and (g) does not vary as a function of estimates from latent semantic analysis (LSA). Based upon these results, it is suggested that researchers take extreme caution in comparing priming effects across different item sets. Moreover, the current findings lend support to spreading activation and feature overlap theories of priming, but do not support priming based upon contextual similarity as captured by LSA.},

These behavioral measures have been integrated with demographic information for each subject and descriptive characteristics for every item. Subjects also completed portions of the Woodcock-Johnson reading battery, three attentional control tasks, and a circadian rhythm measure. These data are available at a user-friendly Internet-based repository ( http://spp.montana.edu ). This Web site includes a search engine designed to generate lists of prime-target pairs with specific characteristics (e.g., length, frequency, associative strength, latent semantic similarity, priming effect in standardized and raw reaction times). We illustrate the types of questions that can be addressed via the Semantic Priming Project. These data represent the largest behavioral database on semantic priming and are available to researchers to aid in selecting stimuli, testing theories, and reducing potential confounds in their studies.},

abstract = {Semantic priming is typically eliminated when participants perform a letter search on the prime, suggesting that semantic activation is conditional upon one's attentional goals. However, in such studies, semantic activation (or the lack thereof) is not measured during the letter search task itself but, instead, is inferred on the basis of the responses given to a later target. In the present study, direct online evidence for semanticactivation was tested using words whose meaning should bias either a positive or a negative response (e.g.,present vs. absent). In Experiment 1, a semantic congruency effect was obtained, with faster responses when the word meaning matched the required response. Experiment 2 replicated the congruency effect while, simultaneously, showing the elimination of semantic priming. It is concluded that letter search does not affect the initiation of semantic activation. Possible accounts for the elimination of priming following letter search include activation-based suppression and transfer-inappropriate processing.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.},

Using participant ratings and computational measures, we demonstrated distinct patterns across measures of similarity and co-occurrence, and familiarity for each relational construct in two different item sets. In a standard lexical decision task (LDT) with various delays between prime and target presentation (SOAs), target RTs and priming magnitudes were consistent across the three relations for both item sets. However, across the SOAs, there were distinct patterns among the three relations on some of the underlying measures influencing target word recognition (LSA, Google, and BEAGLE). These distinct patterns suggest different mechanisms of lexical priming and further demonstrate that integrative relations are distinct from thematic and taxonomic relations.},

Here, we build on work by Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum (2007) and test the ability of spatial semantic models to simulate association data when they are fused with a Luce choice rule to simulate the process of selecting a response in free association. The results provide an existence proof that spatial models can produce the patterns of data in free association previously thought to be problematic.},

However, computational models of semantic memory have seen a surge of progress in the last two decades, advancing our knowledge of how meaning is constructed from experience, how knowledge is represented and used, and what processes are likely to be culprit in disorders characterized by semantic impairment. This chapter provides an overview of several recent clusters of models and trends in the literature, including modern connectionist and distributional models of semantic memory, and contemporary advances in grounding semantic models with perceptual information and models of compositional semantics. Several common lessons have emerged from both the connectionist and distributional literatures, and we attempt to synthesize these themes to better focus future developments in semantic modeling.},

abstract = {A neural network which is capable of recalling without errors any set of linearly independent patterns is studied. The network is based on a Hamiltonian version of the model of Personnaz et al. The energy of a state of N (1) neurons is the square of the Euclidean distancein phase spacebetween the state and the linear subspace spanned by the patterns. This energy corresponds to nonlocal updatings of the synapses in the learning mode. Results of the mean-field theory (MFT) of the system as well as computer simulations are presented. The stable and metastable states of the network are studied as a function of temperature T and =p/N, where p is the number of embedded patterns. The maximum capacity of the network is =1. For all (0{\textless}1) the embedded patterns are not only locally stable but are global minima of the energy. The patterns appear, as metastable states, below a temperature T=TM. The temperature TM() decreases to zero as 1. The spurious states of the network are studied in detail in the case of random uncorrelated patterns. At finite p, they are identical to the mixture states of Hopfields model. At finite , a spin-glass phase exists as a metastable state. According to the replica symmetric MFT the spin-glass state becomes degenerate with the patterns at =g=1-2/ and disappears above it. Possible interpretations of this unusual result are discussed. The average radius of attraction R of the patterns has been determined by computer simulations, for sizes up to N=400. The value of R for 0{\textless}{\textless}1 depends on the details of the dynamics. Results for both parallel and serial dynamics are presented. In both cases R is unity (the largest distance in phase space by definition) at 0 and decreases monotonically to zero as 1. Contrary to the MFT, simulations have not revealed, so far, any singularity in the properties of the spurious states at an intermediate value of . {\textcopyright} 1987 The American Physical Society.},

Both procedures proved effective in mending metacognitive illusions-as reflected in JOLs and self-regulation of study time-but only theory-based debiasing yielded transfer to new items.

The failure to discount the effects of that information when making JOLs can instill a sense of competence during learning that proves unwarranted during testing. Using a paired-associates task, the authors examined aspects of the cue-target relationships that seemed likely contributors to such illusions of competence. These aspects have the potential to create differential strengths of a priori and a posteriori associations, that is, the probability with which a cue, when presented alone, elicits the corresponding target versus the perceived association between the cue and the target when both are present. The authors argue that the former has the greater influence on later recall, whereas the latter has the greater influence on JOLs.},

The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word–word and passage–word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

Although category coordinates were investigated in the majority of studies, synonyms, antonyms, and script relations also demonstrated priming; functional relations showed greater priming, and essential and perceptual relations showed less.

abstract = {Judgments of associative memory (JAM) were indexed by ratings given to pairs of cue and response words. The normed probabilities, p(response|cue), were obtained from free association norms. The ratings were linearly related to the probabilities. The JAM functions were characterized by high intercepts (???50 on a 100 point scale) and shallow slopes ({\textless}0.5). The JAM function generalized across materials and method of rating. The function was not affected by expectancies or semantic similarity. Attempts to alter the function by making alternative responses more available were unsuccessful. A computer simulation model (MINERVA 2) exhibited the linear JAM function and successfully accounted for more complex phenomena (like the joint influence of forward and backward associative strengths on ratings). The shallow JAM slope appears to result from a fundamental lack of discrimination among associative strengths.

abstract = {There has been much debate about the relation between knowledge for meaning (semantic memory) and knowledge for words in context (associative memory). Many measures of that knowledge exist, but do they all measure the same thing? In this study, scaling, clustering, and factor-analytic techniques were used to reveal the structure underlying 13 variables. Semantic similarity determined from lexicographic measures is shown to be separable from the associative strength determined from word association norms, and these semantic and associative measures are in turn separable from abstract representations derived from computational analyses of large bodies of text. The three-factor structure is at odds with traditional views of word knowledge. The ex- pression of long-term knowledge about words and the concepts they represent may be better viewed in terms of associative, semantic, and thematic information.},

abstract = {WordNet, an electronic dictionary (or lexical database), is a valuable resource for computational and cognitive scientists. Recent work on the computing of semantic distances among nodes (synsets) in WordNet has made it possible to build a large database of semantic distances for use in selecting word pairs for psychological research. The database now contains nearly 50,000 pairs of words that have values for semantic distance, associative strength, and similarity based on co-occurrence. Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance. Thus, semantic distance as derived from WordNet appears distinct from other measures of word pair relatedness and is psychologically functional.

abstract = {An alternative to semantic network models of lexical knowledge representation and access is described, in which knowledge about a word is represented as a pattern of activation across a collection of processing units. In this distributed memory model, semantic priming effects arise naturally from the similarity of the patterns of activation that represent a related prime and target. Priming effects can be reduced by an intervening stimulus that modifies the pattern of activation before the target appears. This process is demonstrated empirically with a word naming task. An implemented version of the distributed memory model is used to simulate these results, and results from previous research in which participants overtly responded to the item that intervened between a prime and target are also simulated. Comparisons with semantic network and compound cue models of priming are discussed},

Learning the meaning of a word is thought to be dependent, at least in part, on exposure to the word in its linguistic contexts of use. In two experiments, we manipulated subjects' contextual experience with mar- ginally familiar and nonce words. Results showed that similarity judgements involving these words were af- fected by the distributional properties of the contexts in which they were read. The accrual of contextual experi- ence was simulated in a semantic space model, by succes- sively adding larger amounts of experience in the form of item-in-context exemplars sampled from the British National Corpus. The experiments and the simulation provide support for the role of distributional information in developing representations of word meaning.},

This contradicts a central prediction of distributed models, necessitates questionable revisions of spreading activation and compound cue theories, and has led to the claim that automatic priming does not tap word meaning. Low item similarity was hypothesized to be the primary factor responsible for the previous null effects. Experiment 1 obtained priming with highly similar items using single and paired presentation with lexical and semantic decision tasks. Experiment 2 replicated Shelton and Martin to show that the results of Experiment 1 were not due to methodological factors. Experiment 3 showed priming for highly similar items for short and long SOAs, but for less similar items for a long SOA only. Thus, semantic similarity is an important aspect of semantic relatedness, and automatic priming does tap word meaning.},

The findings were used to estimate the reliability of indices of strength and set size for different types of items and to model free association as a retrieval task. When confined to first responses, reliability was generally high for both indices, particularly for words with smaller sets of associates and stronger primaries. When second responses were included, reliability declined. A second response added new but weak items to the set, and, when the primary associate was not produced on the first opportunity, it tended not to be produced on the second. Relative to when multiple responses are requested, first-response free association provides more reliable indices of the relative strength and set size for a word's strongest associates. A model of free association assuming that a strength distribution underlies each response provided a good fit to the data.},

One hypothesis attributes this effect to cross-target interference arising during retrieval on the assumption that cues with more associates are more likely to be indirectly connected to studied words other than the target. Another attributes the effect to sampling associates of the cue on the assumption that the probability of sampling the target declines as more associates are activated. Findings from four experiments showed that recall varied with cue set size, and, more importantly, that cue set size affected recall independently of the interference produced by cross-target connections. These results were interpreted as supporting a model that attributes cue set size effects to sampling processes associated with the intersection of the test cue and its associates with the target and its associates.},

The effect of number of letters was facilitatory for words of 3-5 letters, null for words of 5-8 letters, and inhibitory for words of 8-13 letters.

During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species.

abstract = {Four lexical decision experiments were conducted to examine under which conditions automatic semantic priming effects can be obtained. Experiments 1 and 2 analyzed associative/semantic effects at several very short stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs), whereas Experiments 3 and 4 used a single-presentation paradigm at two response-stimulus intervals (RSIs). Experiment 1 tested associatively related pairs from three semantic categories (synonyms, antonyms, and category coordinates). The results showed reliable associative priming effects at all SOAs. In addition, the correlation between associative strength and magnitude of priming was significant only at the shortest SOA (66 ms). When prime-target pairs were semantically but not associatively related (Experiment 2), reliable priming effects were obtained at SOAs of 83 ms and longer. Using the single-presentation paradigm with a short RSI (200 ms, Experiment 3), the priming effect was equal in size for associative + semantic and for semantic-only pairs (a 21-ms effect). When the RSI was set much longer (1,750 ms, Experiment 4), only the associative + semantic pairs showed a reliable priming effect (23 ms). The results are interpreted in the context of models of semantic memory.},

It posits cue-dependent probabilistic sampling and recovery from an associative network, but the network is specified as a retrieval structure rather than a storage structure. A quantitative computer simulation of SAM was developed and applied to the part-list cuing paradigm. When free recall of a list of words was cued by a random subset of words from that list, the probability of recalling one of the remaining words was less than if no cues were provided at all. SAM predicted this effect in all its variations by making extensive use of interword associations in retrieval, a process that previous theorizing has dismissed.},

abstract = {Develops a theory of memory retrieval and shows that it applies over a range of experimental paradigms. Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor. The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

These measures are useful for experimental stimulus selection and for evaluating a model's cognitive plausibility as a mechanism that people might use to organize meaning in memory. Although humans are exposed to enormous quantities of speech, practical constraints limit the amount of data that many current computational models can learn from. We follow up on previous work evaluating a simple metric of pointwise mutual information. Controlling for confounds in previous work, we demonstrate that this metric benefits from training on extremely large amounts of data and correlates more closely with human semantic similarity ratings than do publicly available implementations of several more complex models. We also present a simple tool for building simple and scalable models from large corpora quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {Many studies have examined the accuracy of predictions of future memory performance solicited through judgments of learning (JOLs). Among the most robust findings in this literature is that delaying predictions serves to substantially increase the relative accuracy of JOLs compared with soliciting JOLs immediately after study, a finding termed the delayed JOL effect. The meta-analyses reported in the current study examined the predominant theoretical accounts as well as potential moderators of the delayed JOL effect. The first meta-analysis examined the relative accuracy of delayed compared with immediate JOLs across 4,554 participants (112 effect sizes) through gamma correlations between JOLs and memory accuracy. Those data showed that delaying JOLs leads to robust benefits to relative accuracy (g = 0.93). The second meta-analysis examined memory performance for delayed compared with immediate JOLs across 3,807 participants (98 effect sizes). Those data showed that delayed JOLs result in a modest but reliable benefit for memory performance relative to immediate JOLs (g = 0.08). Findings from these meta-analyses are well accommodated by theories suggesting that delayed JOL accuracy reflects access to more diagnostic information from long-term memory rather than being a by-product of a retrieval opportunity. However, these data also suggest that theories proposing that the delayed JOL effect results from a memorial benefit or the match between the cues available for JOLs and those available at test may also provide viable explanatory mechanisms necessary for a comprehensive account.},

abstract = {Since their inception, distributional models of semantics have been criticized as inadequate cognitive theories of human semantic learning and representation. A principal challenge is that the representations derived by distributional models are purely symbolic and are not grounded in perception and action; this challenge has led many to favor feature-based models of semantic representation. We argue that the amount of perceptual and other semantic information that can be learned from purely distributional statistics has been underappreciated. We compare the representations of three feature-based and nine distributional models using a semantic clustering task. Several distributional models demonstrated semantic clustering comparable with clustering-based on feature-based representations. Furthermore, when trained on child-directed speech, the same distributional models perform as well as sensorimotor-based feature representations of children's lexical semantic knowledge. These results suggest that, to a large extent, information relevant for extracting semantic categories is redundantly coded in perceptual and linguistic experience. Detailed analyses of the semantic clusters of the feature-based and distributional models also reveal that the models make use of complementary cues to semantic organization from the two data streams. Rather than conceptualizing feature-based and distributional models as competing theories, we argue that future focus should be on understanding the cognitive mechanisms humans use to integrate the two sources.},

The purpose was to evaluate contrasting predictions made by the partial-retrieval hypothesis and the competition hypothesis. The partial-retrieval hypothesis assumes the more neighboring concepts activated by the test cue, the higher the feeling of knowing. In contrast, the competition hypothesis assumes that feelings of knowing are sensitive to competition between neighboring concepts, and it predicts that the fewer neighboring concepts activated by the cue, the higher the feeling of knowing. The findings were compatible with the competition hypothesis showing that both feeling-of-knowing and prediction-of-knowing ratings always were higher, the fewer different concepts were linked to the test cue. We obtained an identical pattern of results using different kinds of cues including taxonomic category names, ending sounds, and meaningfully related associates. We consider different ways that these findings could be reconciled with the partial-retrieval hypothesis, and we also discuss implications for other explanations of feeling-of-knowing effects.},

Within each block, each word was rated on each of the three variables by 20 partici- pants (undergraduate students from the University of Bristol). Analyses comparing these ratings to existing norm databases demonstrated that this methodology resulted in high reliability (assessed by Cronbach's ) and validity. The ratings were also transformed to be compatible with the Gilhooly and Logie (1980) norms. This transformation resulted in a set of norms for 3,394 words, which is by far the largest database of ratings for AoA, imageability, and familiarity to date. The resulting database should be useful for researchers interested in manipulating or controlling these factors in word recognition, neuropsychological, or memory studies.

Priming was compara-ble in both directions for semantically related pairs. Furthermore, priming was not obtained in either direction when pairs were associated but not semantically similar. The absence of inhibition, practice, and nonword ratio effects suggested that priming was not the result of nonsemantic, controlled processes.
